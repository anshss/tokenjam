# "claude-code" | "sdk" | "mixed" | "unknown"). A name listed for the dominant
# persona is dropped from `selected` in `build_report` BEFORE the dispatch
# loop, so the analyzer is never invoked: it runs no query, produces no
# finding, and is therefore absent from every downstream surface (the CLI
# report, the /optimize payload, the Review inbox). That is deliberately a
# TRUE skip and not an `enabled: False` finding — a disabled analyzer that
# still queries costs the same time and then renders a row whose only honest
# caption is "there is nothing you can do about this."

# time for that persona. Each entry below records which one it misses.

# `mixed` / `unknown` disable nothing: the conservative default is to run
# everything, so an unclassified window never silently loses a finding.

    `personas` decides WHICH ANALYZERS run; this decides WHICH ROWS they read.
    `None` means the whole corpus. Set it and every analyzer's query, and the

    report read without a persona) should see — with a fully-scoped report for
    each of ``personas`` hanging off it under

    **Why not one widened pass.** The dispatch gate can be widened and sliced on
    read because it selects analyzer NAMES, and a set of names is separable. A
    population is not: an analyzer aggregating over Claude Code sessions and SDK
    sessions together produces one number that contains both, and no read-time
    filter can take one back out. So a persona-labelled figure has to be
    computed under that persona's scope, which means a pass each. Each pass is
    also gated to just that persona's analyzer set, so neither pass pays for
    analyzers its persona cannot act on.

    Cost is one corpus pass per scoping persona instead of one in total. That
    is affordable precisely because no request path runs an analyzer — see
    ``core/optimize/report_store.py``; it is background work, and the
    alternative is a wrong number on every persona-scoped surface.

    A persona whose scope is the whole corpus (``mixed`` / ``unknown``) is not

    This exists because the hand-written version was not lossless, and the
    asymmetry was invisible: `report_to_dict` is a generic recursive walk that
    serialises every field, while each `report_from_dict` constructor named its
    fields by hand and silently fell back to dataclass defaults for anything it
    forgot. `resend` alone dropped 19 fields on the way back, including
    `cost_of_waste_usd` and `coverage_note`; `relearn` dropped
    `past_reread_usd` and its whole `below_threshold_*` block.

    That was survivable only while the live path handed the renderer a real
    `OptimizeReport` and just the HTTP shim round-tripped. Once analyzer
    results are served from a store, EVERY consumer round-trips, so a dropped
    dollar field comes back as its default and a surface renders a smaller
    number, or zero, with no error anywhere. A wrong figure that looks like a
    successful read is worse than a failed one.

    Coercion is driven by the resolved type hints: nested dataclasses and lists
    of them recurse, `datetime` fields go through `_parse_dt`, everything else
    passes through. A key absent from `d` is left to the dataclass default, so
    an older or foreign payload still loads.

    `tests/unit/test_report_roundtrip.py` fails if any dataclass field the
    serializer writes does not survive the trip back, so the next analyzer
