"""
Backfill: parse historical agent session logs into NormalizedSpan objects.

Currently supports Claude Code on-disk JSONL files at ~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl.
Each file contains one JSON object per line; relevant types are:
  - "assistant": message.model + message.usage.{input_tokens, output_tokens,
                 cache_read_input_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens}.
                 message.content may contain {"type":"tool_use","name":...,"id":...}.
  - "user":      string content (user prompt) or list with tool_result items
                 (we don't need tool_result for v1 analyzers — tool_use is enough).

Other agent log formats (Codex, etc.) plug in by adding a new iter_* function
that yields the same (BackfillSession, list[NormalizedSpan]) tuples.

Cost is recomputed from pricing/models.toml — the on-disk format has no cost_usd.
Span IDs are deterministic (hash of session_id + assistant uuid / tool_use id) so
backfill is idempotent: re-running ingests no duplicates.

    SOURCE, AND WHY NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. Claude Code writes an
    ``agent-<agentId>.meta.json`` sidecar next to every subagent transcript,
    carrying ``agentType`` — the ``subagent_type`` argument of the spawning
    Task/Agent call, already resolved (a dispatch that omitted the argument
    reads as the default it actually ran under, rather than as absent).

    The natural-looking alternative is to join a sidechain to its dispatching
    ``Task`` call and read ``subagent_type`` off the tool args — a real field,
    which the next reader will find and assume is the source. Rejected because
    that join is only as available as the PARENT transcript, and Claude Code
    prunes transcripts on its own retention setting: wherever the parent has
    aged out, the dispatch is unlinkable, and subagent transcripts outlive their
    parents often enough that this is the common case rather than the edge. The
    sidecar sits beside the child and shares its lifetime, so it is present
    whenever the child is. The two were cross-checked against each other on real
    transcripts and they agree; where they differ it is because the Task call
    omitted the argument and the sidecar records the resolved default, so the
    sidecar is the more correct of the pair, not merely the more available.

    Sidechain records live ONLY under a ``subagents/`` directory, in
    ``agent-<id>.jsonl`` files, one agentId per file (checked both ways on real
    transcripts: no main-thread file carries an ``isSidechain`` record, and no
    subagent file carries more than one distinct ``agentId``), so one per-file
    lookup covers every span this file produces.

    The directory is NOT always the immediate parent: a workflow dispatch nests
    one level further, as ``subagents/workflows/<workflow-id>/agent-<id>.jsonl``.
    Membership is therefore tested against the whole path. A predicate matching
    only ``path.parent`` silently drops every workflow dispatch — silently
    because a missing type is indistinguishable from a dispatch that legitimately
    has none, so nothing raises and no count looks wrong locally. It surfaced
    only as a disagreement between the number of typed spans in the DB and the
    number of typed transcripts on disk.

    Returns None for a main-thread transcript, a missing/garbled sidecar, and a

    Truncating here is behaviour-preserving rather than a trade-off: for a file
    longer than the cap the hash and the sample are computed from bytes that all
    survive, and the length gate still sees a value well over 200; for a shorter

    Returns (newly_inserted, retagged).

    Per-session path: ONE (chunked) `WHERE span_id IN (...)` partitions spans
    into new-vs-existing, then the new spans are appended via the columnar
    `db.bulk_insert_spans` (newline-delimited JSON + DuckDB `read_json`, ~350×
    faster than per-row binding). Its anti-join skips any span_id already present
    (a previous backfill or live ingest already covered it). The full backfill
    (`reingest=False`) drives the even faster cross-session batch path in
    `ingest_claude_code`; this per-session routine remains the `reingest=True`
    path (its per-span attribute overlay is not a bulk op) and the fallback for a
    backend without a `conn`.

    When `reingest` is True, spans that already exist are UPDATEd instead of
    being skipped — this backfills two things onto rows an older/leaner backfill
    wrote:
      - `sub_agent_id`   — re-tags history ingested before that column existed.
      - `sub_agent_type` — same, for the stable subagent identity (migration 19);
        re-running over unchanged transcripts populates it on already-ingested
        spans and is otherwise a no-op (the value is derived from the on-disk
        sidecar, so an unchanged transcript always re-derives the same value).
      - `attributes`   — overlays freshly-parsed captured content
        (`gen_ai.prompt.content` / `gen_ai.completion.content` /
        `gen_ai.tool.input`) onto the stored row when `[capture]` was enabled
        AFTER the span was first ingested (#10). Without this, enabling capture
        later never lands content on already-ingested spans, so the
        recurring-inclusion detection #4 needs (which reads that content) only
        worked against a fresh DB.

    The overlay is a per-key merge of the parsed span's attributes over the
    stored attributes (parsed wins per key) — so it ADDS content keys without
    discarding any keys the stored row already carried (e.g. from live ingest).
    Capture-off reingest is a no-op: the parsed span's attributes are just
    `{"source": ...}`, which the stored row already has, so nothing changes.
    Other span fields are left untouched.
